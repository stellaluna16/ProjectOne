            David Bowie was a well-known musician. I listen to his music when I need inspiration.
            Not only did he have great music, but he also painted well, was a great actor, and was a fashion icon.

            Wes Wilson was a pioneer for psychedelic rock posters in the late 60s and early 70s. He has inspired me to experiment with my designs, as well as find ways to push the societal norms.
